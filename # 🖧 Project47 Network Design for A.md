# 🖧 Project47: Network Design for AK Network Solutions

## 📌 Project Overview
You have been hired as a **Network Engineer** for **AK Network Solutions**, a mid-sized enterprise with a **six-floor** office building. Each floor is equipped with **9 computers**, and the organization requires a **well-structured network** to ensure **efficient communication** and **scalability**.

## 🏗️ Network Design Requirements

### 🔹 1. Topology Selection
- ✅ **Mesh Topology** for the **first three floors** to enhance performance and fault tolerance.
- ✅ **Ring Topology** for the **remaining three floors** to ensure network stability and efficient communication.

### 🔹 2. IP Addressing Scheme
- 🏠 **Class C Private IPv4 Addresses** for the **first two floors**.
- 🌍 **Class A Public IPv4 Addresses** for the **remaining floors**.
- 📌 Follows a **Classful Addressing Scheme**, ensuring **uniqueness** across all floors.

### 🔹 3. Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication & Connectivity
- 🚀 **Static Routing Approach** for **inter-floor communication**.
- 🔄 **Seamless inter-department communication** with optimized routing.
- 🖥️ Selection of **network devices** (e.g., switches, routers, access points) and their placements.
- ⚙️ If **dynamic routing** is considered, suggest an appropriate protocol (**RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP**) with justification.
- 🌐 Define **default gateways** and their respective **IP addresses**.
